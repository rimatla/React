BUNDLE
*************
Option 1 (Small Projects)
Babel Bundle

1a create .babelrc file

2a create index.html on dist dir
2b source bundle.js in your index.html
2c create 1_HelloWorld.jsx on src dir


3 run
$ babel ./src/1_HelloWorld.jsx --out-file ./dist/bundle.js

"It may look like nothing has happened, but something has happened. We've actually transpiled everything into this file called bundle.js. All worked on by Babel."


*************
Option 2 (Bigger Projects)
Webpack Bundle

1 create webpack.config.js file
1b source bundle.js in your index.html accordingly as assets/bundle.js
*On terminal
2 $ webpack

"Per your webpack.config.js configurations , webpack will create an 'assets dir' with a  bundle.js file"

3a now run webpack-dev-server
"all ready for development!"

3a Hack in case webpack-dev-server is not auto refreshing after each change
webpack-dev-server --watch-poll
