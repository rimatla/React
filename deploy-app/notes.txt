Instructions by Jake Wiesler

- Out of the box create-react-app comes with a few handy scripts that allow you to develop your project locally and deploy it afterwards.
- They can be found in the package.json file at the root of your project directory.

$npm install -g create-react-app
$create-react-app <your project name>
$cd <your project name>
$npm start (run project locally)
$npm run build (prepare your project for deployment)


- create-react-app has a script in package.json called build .
- This script essentially prepares the application for production by bundling and optimizing all of the code.
*Deployment with Surge:

$npm install -g surge
$npm run build

- You should notice that a new folder has been created in the root of your project directory called 'build'.
- This folder contains the production-ready application.

run the surge command in your projectâ€™s root:
$surge

- Create your credentials (email and password)
- Project Path Directory to /build
- Customize url name if you so desire

NOTE:
- If your app is using client-side-routing, Surge recommends you rename the index.html file in your build directory to 200.html
BEFORE running the surge command.
You can find out more information in the Surge documentation.

*****REDEPLOYMENT/ UPDATES
After running a new build run of your app you can either:
1- create a CNAME file in your 'build' directory
$cd build
$echo <your project name>.surge.sh > CNAME
- A CNAME file will be newly created

- Then:
$surge
hit enter

**Or
surge --domain <your project name>.surge.sh


**Other commands
$surge teardown <your project name>.surge.sh (deletes app url)
$surge list (show list of apps)
$surge -h (list of useful commands)
