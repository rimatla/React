REACT
- React is used in production by huge companies like Uber, Netflix, and Twitter.
- The DOM (Document Object Model) is the structure of HTML elements that make up a web page.
- The DOM API refers to how these page elements are accessed and changed.
- React made updating the DOM faster by using DOM Diffing.
- DOM Diffing happens when you compare the currently rendered content with the new UI changes that are about to be made.
- React optimizes this by making only the minimal changes necessary.
- With DOM Diffing, JavaScript objects are compared and this is much, much faster than writing to or reading from the actual DOM.

PERFORMANCE
- Whenever you use the functions like Get Element by ID, you're reading from the DOM.
- When you change any of those elements, change classes, change content, you're writing to the DOM.
- Writing to and reading from the DOM is slow, working with JavaScript objects is faster.

BACKBONE
- We also deal with a slower DOM with other frameworks and libraries like Backbone.
- The way that we typically program with Backbone is that we re-render the same data over and over again.
- Even when the changes haven't happen everywhere. This re-rendering slows down our apps a lot.

REACT
- With React, only the minimal changes will be rendered so this is really efficient.
 - Let's say, I needed to update a single item in a billeted list:
  a)I won't get rid of the existing list
  b)I will just make the one required change.
- We never READ from the DOM and we only WRITE to it when a change is required.
